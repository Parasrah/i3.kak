== About

The intent of this plugin is to provide a seamless experience with i3. Had I known how much this would be based
on the plugin from Delapouite/kakoune-i3 I likely would have forked it instead, but I do expect them to diverge
significantly. While I do not currently intend for this to be used by other people, I have done my best to
ensure it can be using your terminal of choice.

Thanks to Delapouite/kakoune-i3 for the initial inspiration
